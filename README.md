## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various property features. Accurate price prediction is valuable for buyers, sellers, real estate professionals, and policymakers, enabling data-driven decision-making and market analysis.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training (Linear Regression and others)
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, R²
- Visualizations: scatter plots, distribution plots, heatmaps
- Coefficient interpretation for linear models
- User input for interactive price prediction

---

## Dataset

The dataset should contain features such as:
- Area (square footage)
- Number of stories
- Parking spaces
- Total rooms
- Main road access
- Guest room availability
- Basement
- Hot water heating
- Air conditioning
- Preferred area
- Price (target variable)

You can use any similar real estate dataset in CSV format.



## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Distribution plots for price and features
- Scatter plots (e.g., area vs. price)
- Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables

---

## Modeling

- Data preprocessing: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features
- Feature selection: select relevant features for modeling
- Model training: fit regression models (e.g., Linear Regression)
- Model interpretation: analyze feature coefficients

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

These metrics assess model accuracy and predictive performance.
